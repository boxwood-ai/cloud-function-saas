- Time to first successful deployment: **Target <5 minutes from clone**

---

## Feature Validation Strategy

### **Before Building:**
1. **User interviews** - Ask developers what they need most
2. **Usage analytics** - Track which commands/flags are used
3. **GitHub issues** - Monitor what users request/complain about

### **After Building:**
1. **A/B test** new features with subset of users
2. **Performance impact** - Ensure new features don't slow core flow
3. **Support burden** - Track if features increase or decrease support requests

## Technical Debt & Refactoring

### **Code Quality Improvements:**
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Improve logging and debugging output
- [ ] Add unit tests for core functions
- [ ] Refactor deployment logic for easier maintenance

### **Architecture Improvements:**
- [ ] Plugin system for different cloud providers
- [ ] Configuration management system
- [ ] Better abstraction between parsing and deployment
- [ ] Async deployment for better user experience

**Priority: Medium** - Don't let technical debt slow down feature development, but address it before scaling to enterprise customers.

This roadmap focuses on **immediate user value** and **adoption drivers** rather than complex technical features. The goal is to make the current Cloud Run approach irresistibly good before adding complexity.
