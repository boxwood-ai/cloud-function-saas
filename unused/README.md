# Unused Files and Directories

This directory contains files and directories that are not currently used in the main project workflow but are preserved for reference or potential future use.

## Contents

- `src/` - Alternative project structure that was not adopted
- `specs/` - Empty directory (was intended for user specs)
- `future/` - Project planning and documentation
- `generated/` - Old generated outputs from previous runs
- `test_terraform_integration.py` - Test file (not currently active)

## Notes

- These files are preserved to maintain project history
- Some may be useful for reference or future development
- Generated outputs in `generated/` can be safely deleted if disk space is needed
- The `future/` directory contains useful planning documents and contribution guidelines
